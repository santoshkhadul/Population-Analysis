# Population Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing population data to derive insights and trends. The project leverages data visualization and statistical techniques to present population trends and their implications effectively.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis of population data.
- **Visualization**: Generate meaningful charts and graphs to represent data trends.
- **Statistical Insights**: Apply statistical methods to uncover patterns and correlations.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the analysis for different datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/santoshkhadul/Population-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Population-Analysis
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
